# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

This project was a bit bigger than the others. In this project, I learned how to handle missing values by calculating the mode and mean when necessary. I also learned how to handle the classification or text-based columns of the data. It was an interesting project. look it up yourself, I made short notes where necessary.

Happy learning ya'll :)
